# Hospital-Length-of-Stay-Prediction-Project

**Project Overview**
This project aims to predict the length of stay for patients admitted to a hospital using machine learning and data analytics techniques. The goal is to provide hospitals with more accurate predictions to improve resource planning and patient management.

**Dataset**
-  Source: Kaggle, with data originally described on https://microsoft.github.io/r-server-hospital-length-of-stay/input_data.html
-  Data Size: 100,000 patient records, including demographics, medical conditions, lab results, and actual length of stay.

**Approach**
-  Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering: Processed missing values and encoded categorical features.
-  Modelling: Developed models using Random Forest, Decision Tree, XGBoost, and a Stacking Regressor.
-  Evaluation: Metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared were used to evaluate model accuracy.

**Technologies Used**
-  Python: pandas, scikit-learn, XGBoost, Matlplotlib, etc.
-  SQL: Data extraction and ETL processes
-  Tableau: Visualization of model outcomes
-  Cloud: Familiarity with AWS for potential deployment
